# INTRODUCTION
<h2>This project provides a tool to visualise food environmental situations if the United States in interactive and comprehensive way by using Shiny app.</h2>  
 </br>
<h2>The Dataset</h2>  
1. Consists of 13 sheets.  
2. There are 3142 rows whereby each row corresponds to each county in the USA.  
3. There are 277 variables which being stored in 9 seperated sheets based on the respective categories.

# DATA SCIENCE AT ONE GLANCE

1. Ask an Interesting Question  
<h5>How is the food environment in the United States?</h5>  
2. Finding and Getting the Data  
<h5>The dataset was found and downloaded at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48731/DataDownload.xls?v=0 .</h5>
3. Exploring the Data
<h5>The dataset was explored and manipulated interactively to allow users to understand the various aspects of each key indicator.</h5>
4. Visualising the Results
<h5>Shiny does the magic. Click next to explore.</h5>

# The Shiny App
1. Curious about the food environment in the United States?
2. How about the different **STATES**?
3. Or details on each individual **COUNTY**?
4. There are 9 major categories and 277 key indicators in total.
5. You choose what you wish to know, we show you on the spot!

# EXPERIENCE WHEN DOING THE PROJECT
1. Better understanding on the food environment of the United States.
2. R coding skill has been improved.
3. One of the most powerful app for interactive visualisation i.e. Shiny has been discovered.
4. Communication skill among team members has been enhanced - one of the essential skills of a data scientist!
